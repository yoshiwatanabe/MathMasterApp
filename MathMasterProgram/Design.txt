----------

XmlData schema -> ProblemTable has ProblemRows and ProblemCell, each has ValueOne and ValueTwo and Operator.
Enum ProblemCategory -> Addition, Subtraction, etc.
IProblemGenerator is the base class. Derived class are actual problem set implementations.
Problem Generator can produce problems that may not fit into 100 pattens. If so, sequenceNumber is added.
IProblemGenerator has Category property
IProblemGenerator has GenerateProblem method.
ProblemManager is a class that helps maintain the collection of ProblemGenerators and manages the problem generation process.
ProblemManager calls the select ProblemSet instances' GenerateProblem, which generates an instance of ProblemTable.

SheetGenerator is a class that knows how to format a ProblemTable generated by a certain IProblemGenerator. A GenericSheetGenerator 
knows how to create a formatted HTML file from the ProblemTable's XML representation using XSLT.
